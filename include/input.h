 * Describe functions that poll for and react to player key input.

 * Since the functions behave similarly in polling but react differently to
 * input, they are split up by the three game states: PREGAME, GAME, and
 * POSTGAME. There is also an additional function for toggling on the secret
 * pokemon sprite mode.
