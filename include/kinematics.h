/**
 * kinematics.h
 *
 * Describe functions and constants that maintain the kinematics of game
 * objects, including obstacles and the player.
 *
 * Kinematics refers to position, velocity, and acceleration in the x and y
 * direction. In practice, the player only uses x and y position, y velocity,
 * and y acceleration; while obstacles only use x and y position and x velocity.
 *
 * The constants in the file refer to base values for the kinematic variables of
 * the player and the obstacles.
